    content: `The QiWu Platform is intended to build an open, shared, and high-performance hub for sharing code and performance data for all users. In its first phase, we will prioritize the construction of a repository for sharing code and performance data related to core operators in sparse matrix and graph computing. We welcome everyone to participate in the co-construction of this platform. Here, you can access relevant modules to view the latest operator performance data and their corresponding source code. We encourage you to submit your optimized code and runtime data to join us in building this platform together.`,
